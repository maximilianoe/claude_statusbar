  <h1>Claude Code Status Bar Monitor</h1>
  <p>A VS Code extension that displays real-time Claude Code usage statistics directly in your status bar.</p>
</div>

## However you run Claude Code

Tokens, cost, messages and per-session context are read from the transcripts, which
Claude Code writes the same way whichever way you start it — the **terminal CLI**,
the **Claude Code VS Code extension**, or both at once. Every running session is
listed, labelled by its project folder.

The 5-hour and weekly limit percentages come from Claude Code itself, which the
extension asks in the background — using the copy of Claude Code that ships with
its VS Code extension, or the CLI. Nothing to set up, and no terminal needed. See
[Real usage limits](#real-usage-limits).

## 📊 Status Bar & Tooltip

The extension starts monitoring when VS Code opens. What the bar shows depends on
whether it can read your real limits:

```
Reset: 02:13:20 | 5h: 6% | 7d: 35% | C: $31.34      Pro / Max subscription
Reset: 02:13:20 | 5h: … | 7d: … | C: $31.34         first reading in progress
Reset: 02:13:20 | C: $31.34 | T: 139.9k | M: 70     API key: no limits exist
```

**Status Bar Components:**
- **Ctx** — context usage for the newest active session; optional and off by default. A `~` marks transcript-derived estimates. Set `showAvailableContext` to show remaining context instead.
- **Reset** — countdown to the session reset (HH:MM:SS)
- **5h** / **7d** — percentage of the real 5-hour and weekly limits used (see
  [Real usage limits](#real-usage-limits))
- **C** — session cost, with `/budget` and a percentage if you set one
- **T** — tokens used (input + output), as a percentage if you set a budget
- **M** — messages, as a percentage if you set a budget

`T` and `M` are omitted while the real limits are shown, to keep the bar short.

**Colour indicators** apply to whichever signal is most reliable — the real
limits first, otherwise your own budget:
- Neutral: below 60%
- Orange: 60-79%
- Red: 80% and above

**Hover over the status bar** for a tooltip with the usage limits, session timing,
cost (session and last 7 days), token breakdown including cache, and burn rates.

## 🎨 Detailed Popup & Advanced Analytics

Click the status bar to open the statistics panel.

**Session Timer** — countdown to the reset, with the window's start and end times.

**Usage Limits** — three tiles with the real percentage consumed of the context
window, the 5-hour window and the weekly window, each with its reset time, plus a
per-session context list. See [Real usage limits](#real-usage-limits).

**Token Usage, Cost Usage, Message Count** — each section shows one bar:
- a **progress bar** with a percentage, when you have set a budget for that metric
- otherwise a **composition bar** showing what the value is made of — tokens by
  model, cost by model, messages by project — with a legend underneath

The composition bar exists because there is no honest denominator to divide by
without a budget; it fills the same slot with real information instead of an
invented percentage.

**Advanced Analytics** — the "More..." toggles expand each section:
- **Token Components**: input, output, cache creation (split by 5-minute and
  1-hour writes) and cache read
- **Burn Rates**: tokens/min, $/min, messages/min
- **Usage by Project**: token distribution across your Claude projects
- **Usage by Model**: shown here when a token budget is set (otherwise it is
  already the composition bar above)

## Real usage limits

Claude Code reports the **actual** percentage of your 5-hour and weekly limits you
have consumed, together with the reset times. This is the only figure that answers
"how close am I to being cut off" — token and cost counts cannot, because real
consumption is weighted by model and effort level.

**Nothing to turn on.** The figures appear on their own shortly after VS Code
starts — the first reading can take up to a minute, and the status bar shows
`5h: … | 7d: …` meanwhile. After that they refresh every two minutes.

**What you get** — three tiles in the popup, plus `5h` and `7d` segments in the
status bar:

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│     CONTEXT      │  5-HOUR WINDOW   │   7-DAY WINDOW   │
│       82%        │        6%        │       88%        │
│  PhotoManager    │  resets 14:35    │ resets Fri 20:01 │
│ ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁    │ ▁▁               │ ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁    │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘

CONTEXT PER SESSION (4)
PhotoManager          82% · just now
claude-statusbar      66% · 1 min ago
Apokryf-Galicyjski    91% · 16 min ago
eBooki                 — · 2 h ago
```

Numbers are green below 60%, amber to 80%, red above. A value Claude Code does not
report shows a dash — context is briefly absent right after `/compact`.

**Context is per session, the limits are per account.** The context window belongs
to one conversation, so with several Claude Code sessions open there is no single
"the" context: each is listed with its own percentage and how old that reading is
(a session that has been idle stops reporting). The Context tile cycles through the
open sessions every two seconds, naming the one it is showing, so the number never
changes owner without saying so. A `~` marks a percentage the extension worked out
from the transcript rather than one Claude Code reported. The 5-hour and weekly
figures need no such split — they are account-wide and identical in every session.

**How it works.** The extension runs `claude -p /usage` in the background — the
same local command as typing `/usage` in a Claude Code session — and reads what it
prints. Claude Code answers with its own sign-in; the extension never reads or
handles any credentials.

- **No model is called**, so it costs nothing and does not count against your
  limits. No session is recorded and your hooks are not run.
- The program is found without any setup: the copy bundled with the **Claude Code
  VS Code extension** (not on `PATH`, located through VS Code), or the **CLI** —
  on `PATH` or in the standard install locations.
- Several VS Code windows share one reading, so Claude Code is started once every
  two minutes however many windows are open.
- The output is text meant for people. The parser accepts the formats Claude Code
  uses and plausible variations (12- and 24-hour clocks, dates with or without a
  year, relative resets, ISO stamps, "left" instead of "used"). If a future
  version prints something it cannot read, the panel says so instead of showing
  empty tiles; the details go to the *Claude Status Bar Debug* output channel.
- If `/usage` ever stopped being a local command and reached the model, the
  extension detects the charge on the first call and stops asking that version.
- If Claude Code signs in with an **API key**, Amazon Bedrock or Google Cloud,
  there are no 5-hour or weekly windows at all — usage is billed per token. The
  section then says so, quoting Claude Code, and points you at the cost figures.
- `Claude: Show Usage Limits Bridge Status` reports which program was asked, when,
  and what it answered.

**Optional: the status line bridge.** `Claude: Enable Real Usage Limits` installs a
small status line script that mirrors the numbers Claude Code hands to a status
line command. It is no longer needed; it only adds second-by-second updates while
a terminal session is open, and readings from both sources are merged. If you
already use a status line, it keeps working — the bridge calls it with the same
input. `Claude: Disable Real Usage Limits` removes the script and restores your
previous status line.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### VS Code Settings

```json
{
  "claudeStatusBar.tokenBudget": 0,            // your token target; 0 = none
  "claudeStatusBar.costBudget": 0,             // your USD target;   0 = none
  "claudeStatusBar.messageBudget": 0,          // your message target; 0 = none
  "claudeStatusBar.refreshInterval": 5,        // 1-60 seconds
  "claudeStatusBar.showProjectName": false,    // project name in the panel header
  "claudeStatusBar.showContextInStatusBar": false,
  "claudeStatusBar.showAvailableContext": false,
  "claudeStatusBar.notifications.sessionEnded": true
}
```


### Budgets are opt-in

**No budgets are applied by default.** Tokens, cost, and messages are shown as
plain measured values, because Anthropic does not publish token or message quotas
and there is nothing honest to divide by: real consumption is weighted by model
and effort level, enforced over a 5-hour window plus weekly windows (Max plans
have two — all models, and Sonnet only), and the 5-hour limits were doubled in
May 2026. The real percentages come from Claude Code, as described above.

If you want a self-imposed pacing target, set one — the status bar then shows a
percentage and warning colours against *your* number, and the popup switches that
metric from a composition bar to a progress bar:

```json
{
  "claudeStatusBar.tokenBudget": 200000,
  "claudeStatusBar.costBudget": 40,
  "claudeStatusBar.messageBudget": 500
}
```

Or run `Claude: Set Budgets`, which asks for all three. `0` (or an empty answer)
means no budget for that metric.

> Upgrading from 0.4.x or earlier: `customTokenLimit`, `customCostLimit` and
> `customMessageLimit` are migrated to the names above automatically, and are still
> read if the migration never ran. The `claudeStatusBar.plan` setting was removed —
> plan presets carried token limits Anthropic never published.

## Installation

### Via VS Code Extension Manager

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Claude Code Status Bar Monitor"
4. Click **Install**

Or visit the [VS Code Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bartosz-warzocha.claude-statusbar)

### Manual Installation

```bash
npm install
npx @vscode/vsce package          # runs the production build, emits the .vsix
code --install-extension claude-statusbar-*.vsix
```

## Usage & Commands

Access via Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- `Claude: Show Usage Details` - Open detailed metrics popup
- `Claude: Enable Real Usage Limits` - Optional: add the status line bridge for live terminal updates
- `Claude: Disable Real Usage Limits` - Remove the bridge, restore your status line
- `Claude: Show Usage Limits Bridge Status` - Diagnose where the usage limits come from
- `Claude: Set Budgets` - Set your token, cost and message targets
- `Claude: Refresh Usage Stats` - Force refresh metrics

## How It Works

### Data Source

Claude Code stores conversation data locally in JSONL files:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.claude/projects/` or `~/.config/claude/projects/`

The extension monitors these files for changes and calculates metrics in real-time.
Every entrypoint writes them identically, so a session started with `claude` in a
terminal and one started from the Claude Code VS Code extension are measured the
same way. Which sessions are currently open is read from Claude Code's own register
in `~/.claude/sessions/`, with the process checked, so a session that has ended
drops off the list instead of lingering.

### Session Windows

Claude Code uses **5-hour rolling sessions**, plus weekly windows. The extension:

1. Detects your first message timestamp
2. Calculates session expiry (5 hours later) — or uses the reset time reported by
   Claude Code, as long as it is still in the future. A reported reset that has
   passed falls back to the locally computed window rather than declaring the
   session over
3. Tracks usage within the active window
4. Automatically resets when the session expires

Session windows are tracked on a rolling basis and are **not** cut at midnight, so
a window that starts at 22:00 keeps its full history past the date boundary.

Only files modified within the last week are read, and parsed results are cached by
modification time, so a large history does not cost CPU on every refresh.

### Token Calculation

**What counts toward limits:**

- ✅ `input_tokens` - Your prompts
- ✅ `output_tokens` - Claude's responses

**What doesn't count toward token limits:**

- ❌ `cache_creation_input_tokens` - Cache overhead
- ❌ `cache_read_input_tokens` - Cache hits

**Note:** Cache tokens ARE included in cost calculations but NOT in token limits.

### Cost Calculation

Costs use per-model published pricing (USD per million tokens), verified against
[Anthropic's pricing page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing)
on 2026-07-26. Note that pricing is per **model version**, not per family — Opus
4.5+ costs a third of what Opus 4.1 did:

| Model | Input | Output | Cache write 5m | Cache write 1h | Cache read |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Fable 5 / Mythos 5** | $10.00 | $50.00 | $12.50 | $20.00 | $1.00 |
| **Opus 5 / 4.8 / 4.7 / 4.6 / 4.5** | $5.00 | $25.00 | $6.25 | $10.00 | $0.50 |
| **Opus 4.1 and earlier** | $15.00 | $75.00 | $18.75 | $30.00 | $1.50 |
| **Sonnet 5** (to 2026‑08‑31) | $2.00 | $10.00 | $2.50 | $4.00 | $0.20 |
| **Sonnet 5** (from 2026‑09‑01) / 4.6 / 4.5 | $3.00 | $15.00 | $3.75 | $6.00 | $0.30 |
| **Haiku 4.5** | $1.00 | $5.00 | $1.25 | $2.00 | $0.10 |

Cache rates are fixed multipliers of the base input price: 1.25x for a 5-minute
cache write, **2x for a 1-hour write**, and 0.1x for a cache read. Claude Code
writes 1-hour cache entries almost exclusively, so treating them as 5-minute
writes understates cache cost by 37.5%.

Also accounted for:

- `speed: "fast"` — fast mode reprices Opus 5 / Opus 4.8 at $10/$50
- `inference_geo: "us"` — US-only inference applies a 1.1x multiplier
- Web search — $10 per 1,000 requests
- Model ids not in the table fall back to their family's rates and log a warning,
  so a newly released model is approximated rather than mispriced as Sonnet

## Privacy

All data processing happens **locally on your machine**:

- ✅ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ No telemetry or analytics
- ✅ No account required
- ✅ Reads only your local Claude files
- ✅ Never reads or handles credentials — for the usage limits it runs Claude Code's
  own `/usage` command, and Claude Code contacts Anthropic with its own sign-in,
  exactly as when you type `/usage` yourself

## Requirements

- **VS Code**: 1.104.0 or higher
- **Claude Code**: an active installation with local conversation data, run from a
  terminal, from the Claude Code VS Code extension, or both
- **Node.js on `PATH`**: required only for the optional status line bridge.
- **Claude.ai Pro or Max**: required for the 5-hour and weekly figures. They do not
  exist for API-key, Amazon Bedrock or Google Cloud sign-ins, where usage is billed
  per token and the cost figures are the relevant ones.
